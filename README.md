This repository stores the data for the KKLT de Sitter vacua obtained in [ArXiv:2406.XXXX](https://arxiv.org)


## Summary

We find compactifications of type IIB string theory that are candidate de Sitter vacua at leading order in the $\alpha^\prime$ and $g_s$ expansions. We begin by specifying explicit Calabi-Yau orientifolds, and choices of quantized fluxes, for which we derive the four-dimensional effective supergravity theories, incorporating the exact flux superpotential, the nonperturbative superpotential from Euclidean D3-branes, and the K\"ahler potential to all orders in $\alpha'$, but at tree level in the string loop expansion. We then exhibit four compactifications that, in the above approximation, yield 48 de Sitter vacua of the form envisioned by Kachru, Kallosh, Linde, and Trivedi. Each example includes a Klebanov-Strassler throat region containing a single anti-D3-brane, whose supersymmetry-breaking energy causes an uplift to a metastable de Sitter vacuum in which all moduli are stabilized. We additionally construct a landscape of supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric anti-de Sitter vacua with Klebanov-Strassler throats. For all of these vacua, corrections in the $\alpha'$ and $g_s$ expansions are potentially important but are not fully known.  Moreover, whether the flux quantization conditions in Calabi-Yau orientifolds permit odd integer flux quanta is unclear. Finding vacua that demonstrably survive subleading corrections, and in which the quantization conditions are completely understood, is an important open problem for which this work has prepared the foundations.

## Reading and validating the data





To read the data, we recommend using the notebook [`reading_data.ipynb`](/notebooks/reading_data.ipynb).

> [!NOTE]
> We intend to upload further candidate de Sitter solutions to this repository in future data releases.



We provide code to validate the examples presented in the paper.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The code requires basic functions from [CYTools](https://cy.tools). For help with the installation, please check out the relevant [documentation](https://cy.tools/docs/getting-started/).
